Hi👋, my name is **Fromsa**. I'm pursuing an **[Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Photonics for Security, Reliability, and Safety (PSRS)](https://www.master-photonics4security.eu/)**, which has taken me across Europe. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering from Tianjin University. Proficient in Chinese, I cherish my time in China. (我很喜欢中国文化和中餐)。


## Research and Professional Interests

- 🤖 **Computer Vision & Deep Learning**: Applications in **biometrics**, **hyperspectral image analysis**, and **medical imaging**.

- 🩺 **Photonics and Biomedical Imaging**: Advanced imaging techniques for healthcare and security.

- Also interested about industrial PhD programs that bridge academia and industry.
