## 🔬 **About Me**  
My name is **Fromsa** ( ፍሮምሣ ), meaning "a matchmaker" – a fitting metaphor for my goal to connect research with real-world applications. I'm pursuing an **[Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Photonics for Security, Reliability, and Safety (PSRS)](https://www.master-photonics4security.eu/)**, which has taken me across Europe. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering from **[Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/)** (China), where I worked on **Amharic character recognition** and **Cyclopentanol pilot plant design**. Proficient in Chinese, I cherish my time in China. (我很喜欢中国文化和中餐)。

### 🚀 **Research and Professional Interests**  
I am passionate about:
- 🩺 **Photonics and Biomedical Imaging**: Advanced imaging techniques for healthcare and security.
- 🤖 **AI & Deep Learning**: Applications in **biometrics**, **hyperspectral image analysis**, and **medical imaging**.

I am also interested about industrial PhD programs that bridge academia and industry.
