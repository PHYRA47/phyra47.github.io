Hi👋, my name is **Fromsa**. I am a second-year master's student in the **[Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Photonics for Security, Reliability, and Safety (PSRS)](https://www.master-photonics4security.eu/)**. I am specializing in **biometrics** and **computer vision** at Université Paris-Est Créteil (UPEC). 

I am passionate about research in **hyperspectral imaging**, **computer vision**, and their applications in fields like **biometrics** and **biomedical imaging**. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in photonics and machine learning, with hands-on experience in areas such as **spectral image analysis**, and **face recognition**.  

Previously, I completed my first two semesters at **Université Jean Monnet** in France and the **University of Eastern Finland**. I also hold a **Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering and Technology** from Tianjin University, China. Proficient in Chinese, I cherish my time in China. (我很喜欢中国文化和中餐)。
